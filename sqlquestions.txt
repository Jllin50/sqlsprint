- In the Northwind database, what is the type of relationship between the
  `Employee` and `Territory` tables?

  In the Northwind database the Employee and Territory tables have a many to many relationship. 
  Even though there is only one territory id for every employee id, the use of the intermediary table EmployeeTerritories makes this relationship many to many. 


- What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is appropriate, and
  what is a situation where it is not appropriate?

  A situation where a nosql database like Mongo would be appropriate would be if there was live data that needs to be stored quickly because nosql has dynamic schema. 
  It would be harder to feed data with an uncertain schema into a regular sql db because the schema would have to be updated everytime there is a new column or new type of data. 
  In sitations where there is more complex data or more advanced queries are required SQL is prefered. 
  This is because advanced queries are a strongpoint of SQL and it is tedious to dig through a json document of MongoDB with 40 nested layers, for example. 

- What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?

NewSQL is an attempt to make up for the shortcomings of SQL and NoSQL by providing a more horizontally 
scalable relational DB that still maintains the ACID transactional consistency properties.
